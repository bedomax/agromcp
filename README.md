# ðŸŒ¾ AgroMCP

**AgroMCP** is an open-source reference implementation of the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** â€” a lightweight server template for connecting agricultural data to AI models like **Gemini** and **GPT-5**.

This project exposes simple mock endpoints (`/labors`, `/costs`, `/workers`, `/crops`) that can be accessed through the MCP schema defined in [`mcp.json`](./mcp.json).  
It's designed as a starting point for building AI copilots that understand farm operations.
